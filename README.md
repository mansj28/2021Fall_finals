Analysis - Crimes in the U.S. (State-wise)

Overview
Crime analysis has become an essential tool in law enforcement to enhance public safety, identify emerging trends, allocate resources, and plan crime-prevention strategies. Understanding the factors that majorly influence crimes has become an important aspect to curb the crimes, therefore we will be focusing on the below-mentioned analysis and hypotheses to identify the significant factors that, in our view, are influencing crimes across the US

Hypothesis 1:
Reference from :
Crime rates by state size : Based on our data taken from https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/downloads
Highly populated states tend to have higher crime rates throughout the state
From this reference article - https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45236.pdf we are extending on the hypothesis that rate of education has no impact on crime rates.

Hypothesis 2:
Having the same political party at the state influences the number of crimes.

Hypothesis 3:
Crime rates during holiday season are more compared to non-holiday season, we are extending this from the analysis from the below article
